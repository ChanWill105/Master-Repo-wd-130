        <p1>Hey everyone! Glad to be back at BYU-I. I took a break for about a year and a half to work during covid. I
            grew up in Blackfoot Idaho where I have been a member of the church since I was 8.</p1>
        <p2>I am currently deciding between software engineering or video communications as my major. I am taking a mix
            of classes this semester to try and decide which path to take.</p2>
